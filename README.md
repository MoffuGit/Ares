the zig project it's going to get used by the desktop app(electrobun) and
for the cli app (opentui)

the worktree components can get used for other part of the core
the monitor can get used for monitoring the settigns and theme files
and the io can get used for write file outside the worktree,
the worktree would only consume them and not own them
